Special thanks to the JavaScript30 Coding Challenge for providing me with help for this project.
I went through the tutorial and created the project, but then created a second without the tutorial,
taking subtle references from the first-time-around if I needed help. It has really helped ingrain 
CSS3/JavaScript into my mind. 



This project was about expanding and shrinking div elements, adding style and customization to them as desired. 

It was a simple project which again used far more CSS3 than HTML5 or JavaScript combined. 
However, learning advanced CSS3 is nice because it opens the door to new concepts you wouldn't know about otherwise. 
Knowing these concepts allows me to build better websites for companies
or more-stylized applications for those in need.
